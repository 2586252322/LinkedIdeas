# Linked Ideas

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/fespinoza/linked-ideas-osx/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fespinoza/linked-ideas-osx)

The application is to lay out some ideas in the computer, allowing you to
connect them, reorder them and classify them with color codes

On the other hand, the connexions between ideas can have text on its own as a
way to 'explain' the connexion of ideas.
