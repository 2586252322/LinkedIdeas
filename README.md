# Linked Ideas

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/fespinoza/linked-ideas-osx/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fespinoza/linked-ideas-osx)

The application is to lay out some ideas in the computer, allowing you to
connect them, reorder them and classify them with color codes

On the other hand, the connexions between ideas can have text on its own as a
way to 'explain' the connexion of ideas.

## A world of ideas

- dismiss construction arrow on click
- construction line not on same worker
- BUG: LinkArrow when there is no intersection point with conceptViews
- BUG: dragging fails many times when concepts has already many links
- control + dragging to create straight links
- aligment of concepts
- center text
- copy/paste/duplicate concepts/links
- refactor conceptView/linkView use a delegate to decouple from Canvas
- fix link views to be outside canvas ???
- resizing of text field goes to the right
